# JAVA_SPRINGBOOT_DEPENDENCY-INJECTION
🌱 Spring Boot Dependency Injection (DI)
This project demonstrates how Dependency Injection (DI) works in Spring Boot using annotations and Java-based configuration. It explains how Spring manages object creation, wiring, and lifecycle through the Inversion of Control (IoC) container.

📌 What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a design pattern where an object’s dependencies are provided by an external framework instead of being created manually.
Spring Boot uses an IoC Container to manage beans and automatically inject required dependencies at runtime.

🔧 Features Covered

Constructor-based Dependency Injection

Setter-based Dependency Injection

Field-based Dependency Injection using @Autowired

Bean creation with @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Configuration

Bean lifecycle management

Loose coupling between classes
